### The repo for Kontribute - an open source dapp built for the Internet Computer

In heavy development:

- Read & vote on stories
- Mint, buy, sell NFTs
- Create Stories

We are working on new NFT and Interactive story solutions to bring these features to fruition.

## Some notes:
- Local Internet Identity is placed in App.jsx line 47 - replace this in Prod
- We have a set of test canister IDs that we launch as a (Test Net)
- See branch 'Alpha' for recent updates to the dapp
